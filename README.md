<h1>Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
This scenario is based on a fictional company: <br/>
<br/>
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognized that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. <br/>
<br/>

<h2>Task</h2>

I am tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision-makers at the company. I am going to create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured. <br/>

I used the [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Josef314314/RespondSecurityIncident-NIST_CSF-/blob/main/Incident%20report%20analysis.pdf) resource to guide me through this task. <br/>

The <b>System Description</b> and <b>Scope</b> was already provided by the team. <br/>

  - The <b>System Description</b>  highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.<br/>

  - The <b>Scope</b> specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment.<br/>

<h2>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h2>

[See the Qualitative Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/Josef314314/RespondSecurityIncident-NIST_CSF-/blob/main/Incident%20report%20analysis.pdf)
  - To calculate the overall Risk score (1-9) for each threat, I used the following formula (likelihood x severity = risk).
