<h1>Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
This scenario is based on a fictional company: <br/>
<br/>
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognized that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. <br/>

I am tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. I going to create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured. <br/>

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. <br/>

To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 

- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
- An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
<br/>

<h2>Task</h2>

As a cybersecurity analyst, I am tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve the company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). I will use the CSF to help navigate through the different steps of analysing this cybersecurity event and integrate the analysis into a general security strategy.
I have broken down the analysis into different parts. You can explore them here:

- Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. <br/>
- Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. <br/>
- Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. <br/>
- Respond to contain, neutralise, and analyse security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. <br/>
- Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident. <br/>
